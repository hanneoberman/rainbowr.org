[posit::conf(2024)](https://posit.co/conference/) is taking place in Seattle, August 12-13, 2024.

## Talk

We're in the conference programme, in the [Lightning Talks](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf24/publiccatalog/page/publiccatalog/session/1712003933811001s83h) session, on Tuesday, August 13, 1:00pm -- 2:20pm PDT, in room Columbia A/B. We're the final talk in session: "rainbowR - a community that supports, connects and promotes LGBTQ+ people who code in R".

The talk is being presented as a pre-recorded video, since unfortunately Ella can't be at the conference in-person. The video will be available after the conference.

## People

From the rainbowR team, Daniel Sjoberg will be representing the community in-person at the conference, so look out for him.

## Lunch

We don't have officially reserved tables for lunch, but Daniel will put a rainbowR poster, and stickers, on a couple of tables in the Regency Ballroom, so come and hang out with the community there. Everyone welcome, LGBTQ+ folk and allies alike!

## Birds of a Feather

We'll be at the [BoF session on Wednesday](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf24/publiccatalog/page/publiccatalog/session/1713964378486001kNZw), 12:30pm -- 1:00pm, in the Level 5 gallery. We're not officially listed in the session, but we have been promised space in the Level 5 gallery foyer, and Daniel will be there, again with rainbowR posters and stickers.

## Posters and stickers

Here's the poster to look for:^[Because this was designed for print, the colours are slightly different to those that we use on the website and for other online images.]

We have stickers too!

Daniel has them, and there should be some left around the conference space.

If you'd like a sticker and won't be in Seattle, ping Ella a (direct) message in the Slack group, or via [hello@rainbowr.org](mailto:hello@rainbowr.org) with your address and she'll send you some.
