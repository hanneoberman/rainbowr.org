We are planning our first rainbowR book club. The book for discussion is **Queer Data: Using Gender, Sex and Sexuality Data for Action** by Kevin Guyan. See [kevinguyan.com/queer-data/](https://kevinguyan.com/queer-data/){target="_blank"} for more about the book and a variety of gay-friendly places to purchase it.

If you're interested in participating in the book club, could you please fill in this form by **Sept 30th, 2024**. This will help us guage numbers and determine how many sessions to hold and when.

We'll update this page as plans develop. We'll promote on [Slack](https://rainbowr.slack.com) and through our newsletter, both of which you can access when you [join the community](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y7SOWE3IW-fpR_5Cd4mK-CMUpFZ-hvhY4cTj34JqTVE/){target="_blank"}. We'll also promote on [Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@rainbowR){target="_blank"}.
