We are planning our first rainbowR book club. The book for discussion is **Queer Data: Using Gender, Sex and Sexuality Data for Action** by Kevin Guyan. See [kevinguyan.com/queer-data](https://kevinguyan.com/queer-data/){target="_blank"} for more about the book and a variety of gay-friendly places to purchase it.

We'll update this page as plans develop. We'll promote on [Slack](https://rainbowr.slack.com) and through our newsletter, both of which you can access when you [join the community](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y7SOWE3IW-fpR_5Cd4mK-CMUpFZ-hvhY4cTj34JqTVE/){target="_blank"}. We'll also promote on [Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@rainbowR){target="_blank"}.
