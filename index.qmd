# About rainbowR

rainbowR is a community that supports, promotes and connects LGBTQ+ people who code in the R language.

Not every work or social environment is safe or supportive for LGBTQ+ people, so the need to have a dedicated community continues.

We use LGBTQ+ people as a term to cover

-   those who identify as being a minority sexual orientation, i.e. those who are not straight/heterosexual

-   those who are not cisgender, i.e. those whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex

To our straight, cis friends: we very much appreciate your allyship and your support of rainbowR, e.g. by sharing our information and posts on social media and by telling your friends and colleagues about us.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to support, promote and connect LGBTQ+ people in the R community and to and spread awareness of LGBTQ+ issues through data-driven activism.

## Involvement

If you want to join our Slack, please fill in the [sign-up form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y7SOWE3IW-fpR_5Cd4mK-CMUpFZ-hvhY4cTj34JqTVE/) for an invitation. Please note that this group is for LGBTQ+ people.

We welcome everyone, LGBTQ+ or not, who is interested in promoting LGBTQ+ people and issues in the R community and beyond, to follow and engage with us on Mastodon, [tech.lgbt/@rainbowR](https://tech.lgbt/@rainbowR).

## Partnerships

We partner with fellow R diversity and inclusion-orientated groups such as [R Forwards](https://forwards.github.io) and [R Ladies](https://rladies.org).
