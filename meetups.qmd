## About our meetups

We hold online meetups, over Zoom, approximately monthly. 
We usually announce meetups a couple of weeks before they take place.
The best place to hear about them is on [Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@rainbowR) or via our mailing list, which you can opt in to when you [join](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y7SOWE3IW-fpR_5Cd4mK-CMUpFZ-hvhY4cTj34JqTVE/).

These are friendly, informal gatherings, to connect with fellow community members and chat (mostly about R).

Each meetup starts with a round of introductions. The majority of the meetup is usually spent on a 'show and tell'. Participants can share something related to R or Quarto. 
It could be something they're working on, or a resource/package they've found that they're enjoying using. It's also a chance to ask R-related questions -- there's probably someone on the call who can help! Of course, you don't have to show something -- there's no pressure to do so!

We may also use some of the meetup to talk about rainbowR matters, e.g. discussing initiatives for the group, community organisation etc.

We require registration in advance. This helps keep the meetup safe.
