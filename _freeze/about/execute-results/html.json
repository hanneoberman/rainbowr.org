Please note that this group is for LGBTQ+ people.\n\nWe welcome everyone, LGBTQ+ or not, who is interested in promoting LGBTQ+ people and issues in the R community and beyond, to follow and engage with us on Mastodon, [tech.lgbt/@rainbowR](https://tech.lgbt/@rainbowR).\n\n## Partnerships\n\nWe partner with fellow R diversity and inclusion-orientated groups such as [R Forwards](https://forwards.github.io) and [R Ladies](https://rladies.org).\n\n## Meet the team!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"25%\"}\n![](images/people/ella.jpeg)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"5%\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n**Ella Kaye (she/her)**, community co-founder and co-lead\n\nElla is a Research Software Engineer in the Department of Statistics at the University of Warwick, UK.
