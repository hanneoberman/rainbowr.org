For the October meet-up, though, clocks will *not* have shifted yet in the US. \n\nThis meet-up is on the 5th Wednesday of October (not the usual 4th).\n:::\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n![](images/rainbowR-next-meetup.svg)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n**Wednesday October 30th 2024, 5pm UTC, Zoom**\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n`<a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUtdO6prj0sGdRq-hNo2neH9wV6g9NDp_fn\" class=\"icon-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i class=\"fas fa-check\"></i> register</a>`{=html}\n\nGet the time in your timezone, e.g.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nymd_hms(\"2024-10-30 17:00:00\") |>\nwith_tz(\"Europe/Vienna\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"2024-10-30 18:00:00 CET\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nymd_hms(\"2024-10-30 17:00:00\") |>\nwith_tz(\"America/Los_Angeles\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"2024-10-30 10:00:00 PDT\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n::::\n\n## Save the dates\n\nWe will have two more meet-ups in 2024:\n\n- **[Wednesday October 30th, 5pm UTC, Zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUtdO6prj0sGdRq-hNo2neH9wV6g9NDp_fn)**\n\n- Some time in the first half of December, date TBC.\n  \n\nSign-up links will be posted here and shared via [Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@rainbowR){target=\"_blank\"} and our newsletter 2-3 weeks beforehand, which you can opt-in to when you [join the community](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y7SOWE3IW-fpR_5Cd4mK-CMUpFZ-hvhY4cTj34JqTVE/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n## About our meetups\n\nWe hold online meetups, over Zoom. These will usually be on the the 4th Wednesday of each month, at 5pm UK time (i.e. 4pm UTC in the summer, 5pm UTC in the winter).\n\nWe usually promote meetups a couple of weeks before they take place.\nThe best place to hear about them is on [Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@rainbowR) or via our mailing list, which you can opt in to when you [join](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y7SOWE3IW-fpR_5Cd4mK-CMUpFZ-hvhY4cTj34JqTVE/).\n\nThese are friendly, informal gatherings, to connect with fellow community members and chat (mostly about R).\n\nEach meetup starts with a round of introductions, followed by any updates from the rainbowR team, e.g. discussing initiatives for the group, community organisation etc.\nThe majority of the meetup is usually spent chatting about R. We invite participants to 'show and tell' -- they can share something related to R or Quarto. \nIt could be something they're working on, or a resource/package they've found that they're enjoying using. \nIt's also a chance to ask R-related questions -- there's probably someone on the call who can help! \nOf course, you don't have to show something -- there's no pressure to do so!\n\n\nWe require registration in advance. This helps keep the meetup safe.\n",
