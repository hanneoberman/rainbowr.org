The book for discussion is **Queer Data: Using Gender, Sex and Sexuality Data for Action** by Kevin Guyan. See [kevinguyan.com/queer-data/](https://kevinguyan.com/queer-data/){target=\"_blank\"} for more about the book and a variety of gay-friendly places to purchase it.\n\nIf you're interested in participating in the book club, could you please fill in this form by **Sept 30th, 2024**. This will help us guage numbers and determine how many sessions to hold and when. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n`<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScv9r7hkBBubSUibSGQYHWyNZoGTsEbb1aSHAmvTwW_94A32A/viewform\" class=\"icon-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i class=\"fas fa-list\"></i> register interest</a>`{=html}\n\n\nWe'll update this page as plans develop.
