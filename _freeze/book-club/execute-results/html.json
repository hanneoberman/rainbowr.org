The book for discussion is **Queer Data: Using Gender, Sex and Sexuality Data for Action** by Kevin Guyan. See [kevinguyan.com/queer-data](https://kevinguyan.com/queer-data/){target=\"_blank\"} for more about the book and a variety of gay-friendly places to purchase it.\n\nSince rainbowR is an international community, we're running the book club in two cohorts, to accommodate a range of time-zones. For both cohorts, sessions will be on the **second Thursday of the month** (with the exception of February 2025, which will be on the third Thursday).\n\n- Cohort 1: **3pm GMT**\n- Cohort 2: **11pm GMT**\n\nThe meetings will be held on Zoom. Click on the buttons below to register for a cohort (you only need to register once to sign-up for all sessions). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n`<a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0ode-gqDMsHdNEPsDFA83NUpESxT3ZdBx5\" class=\"icon-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i class=\"fas fa-check\"></i> register for cohort 1</a>`{=html}\n`<a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYlcO2urDIuE9QAEGRAF_rUXgIWAktFyZ1a\" class=\"icon-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i class=\"fas fa-check\"></i> register for cohort 2</a>`{=html}\n\n**The book club is open to LGBTQ+ folk and allies**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our cohorts, we propose discussing the book in **five sessions** (though each cohort can decide in the first session whether that works for them and amend accordingly if not):\n\n| Date           | Chapters         |\n|----------------|------------------|\n| Nov 14th, 2024 | Introduction     |\n| Dec 12th, 2024 | 1, 2             |\n| Jan 9th, 2025  | 3, 4             |\n| Feb 20th, 2025 | 5, 6             |\n| Mar 13th, 2025 | 7, 8, Conclusion |\n\n</br>\nWe are then hoping for a **final session** with the author, Kevin Guyan. He'd love to join for a discussion/Q&A about the book once we're done reading it. We'll need to find a convenient date/time that suits him and as many book club participants as possible. It is likely we'll need to combine the two cohorts for this. \n\nThere are two channels in the rainbowR [Slack](https://rainbowr.slack.com) (one for each cohort) for further discussion and organisation. *In particular, it would be great to have volunteers to lead the discussion of a chapter*.
